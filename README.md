# DengAI-PredictingDiseaseSpread

Introduction:
Disease control is an important aspect of a society to keep its inhabitants healthy. Every year many organizations spend a considerable amount of money and time to research about each disease and how to prevent them. In-order to do this, they require proper data (analyzed data) to help achieve a common goal. We as data scientists should provide our analysis on the available data and as machine learning students, we should be able to predict the disease spread based on the data we have. This is precisely what we have done in our project. We have analyzed the data set obtained from drivendata.org (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/), done the necessary pre-processing on it and then have used multiple models to predict the total cases for any given condition.

Problem Description:
The data set for predicting total number of Dengue cases that might occur at any given time for any condition provided that the conditions are within the range of features considered for training the model are obtained.

Conclusion:
Among all the regression models that was used, it was observed that Gradient Boosting technique resulted in best prediction and was also more accurate. This is because Gradient Boosting, build trees sequentially one at a time where each new tree helps to correct the previously trained tree errors.
